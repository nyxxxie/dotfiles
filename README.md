# Nyx's dootfiles v2.0

Some things in here assume that they are located in $HOME/.dotfiles, so make
sure you clone this repo there.  I'll probably add a script to automate
symlinking everything in here later.

Programs these files use or require:

 program | purpose
------------------------------------------
 urxvt   | Preferred terminal emulator
 vim     | Default text editor
 tmux    | Terminal multiplexer
 xset    | Used to add our fonts
 xrdb    | Used to load Xresources file
 awesome | Window manager this theme uses
