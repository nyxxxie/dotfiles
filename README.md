## Installation

Install assumes that dotfiles are located in $HOME/.dotfiles.  Please check
config directories for specific expectations and installation instructions.
I'll probably make a script to automate this at some point (NOTE TO FUTURE
ME: make a bash script per directory that handles install, removal, etc)

## Important notes

CAPS_LOCK is rebound in this theme to super.  If you are a frequent user of the
cruise control for cool, I apologise.
